Your website must consist of 3 pages:

Every page must have the same header menu and a footer section.

**Header:**

* The links do not need to work (example: use \<a href=”#”\>).


**Footer:**
* The footer must contain a copyright and social media links.
* You may choose which social media icons to show. Social media icons do NOT need to belinked to an actual location.

This is the homepage for the website. In addition to the page header and footer, the page has these sections:

* For each pricing option, display:
  - The name of the ticket pricing option
  - Price
  - Ticket Details (what’s included at this price?),
  - BUY TICKETS link/button.
* Clicking BUY TICKETS should navigate the user to the Purchase Ticket page.
